This project is a console application and coded using the java language.
The project creates a field by asking the user for row and column information and fills this field with random mines. 
It shows the proximity of the mine with numbers such as 0 1 2 3, just like in a classic minefield game.
The user loses when he steps on a mine, and wins when he chooses all areas without mines.
Here some screenshots from the application.
